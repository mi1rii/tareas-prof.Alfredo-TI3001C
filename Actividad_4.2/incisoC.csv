Kauai is amazing, and if you're going for the first time you I'm very excited for you! Our condo at Hanalei Bay Resort is perched with a spectacular view of the mountains and bay. Since I don't live on the island I won't meet guests in person, but work closely with our local property manager and the resort to ensure a wonderful stay. 

One thing to note about my listings here - you may notice each one has pictures of the same room. That is because it is! Our condo is a 3BR condo that can be rented as a 1, 2 or 3BR (the middle unit is the master suite with the kitchen and living room, and then there are 2 lockout - 1 on each side).

We finally broke down and bought our property on The Big Island of Hawai'i early in 2013.  We have a 30-tree mango orchard on our one-acre lot which sits about 800' above Kealakekua Bay.   We also own a lot very close to the property, and we are considering expanding the orchard.

We fell in love with South Kona and the expansive views of the coast and the sea - as well as the myriad of activities the area offers - ocean sports of all kinds, hiking, biking, running, etc.

I am retired and live on the property pretty much full time. Terry continues to run his own business and travels around the world.  We have a dog named Kona (we didn't name her - she came to us with that moniker!) who loves to play with tug toys.  If you visit, you'll see what we mean.

We are avid hikers, and I can steer you to some great spots near our property and around the island.  I study Hawaiian and Hawaiian culture at our local Community College, and I am becoming well-versed in matters of Hawaiiana.  I was a social worker, a therapist, a professor, a theatre director, and an actor.

We enjoy meeting new people and swapping tales of travels.  We love sharing our island with others.  Life is Good.  Come visit!

From there, head down the slopes into rain forests that ooze with Garden of Eden visions—400-foot waterfalls, tropical streams bordered with native trees such as ’ohi’a, ’olapa and kolea, and warm turquoise pools that invite an invigorating swim. Next, glide along the surface of the ocean on a surfboard or catamaran then dip below to greet a whole new world. Here, brilliant colors are the norm. It’s like diving into your own private ""National Geographic"" episode.<br /><br />Day done—dig your toes into the sand, listen to the music of the waves and let your cares float away.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/c4d89b2b-ee43-441e-9b90-03dc1159cb0f.jpg,19139775,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19139775,Lorie,2014-07-29,"Cathedral City, CA","Like you, I love to travel, including cruising. I love to help people. I love to be hospitable. I love to read, especially about the places I am about to visit in my travels and adventures.  My husband and I have visited most of the European countries, north and south, as well as: Turkey, Israel, Greece. Southeast Asia, and the Western Rockies of the United States and Western Canada. We have also visited the western shores of South America.

""What you know is a function of whom you choose to believe."" This is my husband's (Ph.D.) saying. Of course, I believe it.

I just retired after thirty (30) years with one company. Now, I am enjoying sharing our  luxurious vacation resort (which has properties around the world and within the USA). Name any place on this globe, and I will try to help you make your dream vacation or travel experience come true.

I’ve been exploring and loving the islands, people, and culture of Hawai'i for nearly four decades. I bought my first property on O'ahu in 1983, and during the 45-day escrow period, I earned my State of Hawai'i real estate license. Just two years later, I purchased the company I’d been working for; upon selling that business in 1986, I began and built my company, Fidelity Properties, from the ground up.  I purchased this beautiful (undeveloped) property in 1989 and built my home and the rental home and, over the years, I've nurtured the 'aina (land).  I enjoy swimming,  boating, and staying active.  Most importantly,  I am happy to share this paradise with you. 

Why this property?  ""Keep the COUNTRY country.""  You will see intermittent signs along the road on your way to the home.  The village of Waikane is in ""the country""  away from the developed and more congested and populated areas of the island, and residents would like to keep it that way!  Here, there are flower farms and  and fruit trees.....a little bit of yesteryear and a country road that hugs the shoreline and takes you along an incredibly scenic drive along the windward coastline and onto the North Shore.  The quiet, windward side of O'ahu, from Kahuku to Kaneohe, is renowned for its lush vegetation, breezy trade winds, spectacular beaches, friendly little towns, and laid-back lifestyle.  With just about everything close at hand and several convenient avenues to Honolulu as well as the North Shore, it is no wonder I fell in love with and chose windward O'ahu, backdropped by the dramatic Ko'olau Mountain range, for my home and business base.  The nearest town is Kane'ohe, only a 15-minute drive, where you will find a variety of restaurants and shopping, a newly-expanded mall, movie theaters, and grocery stores.

My name is Quinten and I was born and raised here Oahu. I graduated from Loyola Marymount University in 2015 in LA with a degree in Entrepreneurship and International Business. I worked as an English Language teacher for a bit here in Oahu while helping my mom renovate the guest house we are now offering on Airbnb.

I personally shy away from the beaches here ironically, but I do know the right spots to go; its inevitable to go to the beach growing up and living here. I also have many good recommendations for hikes, places to eat, and other sightseeing spots.

The best part about running a vacation rental thus far has been introducing our guests to our cats, dog, and turtle.

Just one mile up the road, the picturesque 153-acre Kualoa Regional Beach Park offers sweeping mountain and ocean views, picnic lawns, and beach access, while Kualoa Ranch & Zipline, a 4,000-acre private nature reserve and working cattle ranch, offers a plethora of activities: horseback riding, ATV riding, zip-lining, and tours of Hollywood film locations. <br />For a literal and delicious taste of Aloha, you'll want to visit <br />Tropical Farms Macadamia Nut Farm, just up the road from the vacation home, which began years ago as a simpl",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/42f9e3d0-becf-48ff-86ca-786a344476de.jpg,64815963,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/64815963,Gail,2016-03-28,"Kaneohe, HI","Born and raised in western Massachusetts, about as far away as one can possibly be from Hawai'i and still be in the United States, I arrived on O'ahu for a one-month vacation in 1980…but Hawai'i is hard to get out of one's system and I stayed to make Hawai'i my new home state. I’ve been exploring and loving the islands, people, and culture of Hawai'i for nearly four decades. I bought my first property on O'ahu in 1983, and during the 45-day escrow period, I earned my State of Hawai'i real estate license. Just two years later, I purchased the company I’d been working for; upon selling that business in 1986, I began and built my company, Fidelity Properties, from the ground up.  I purchased this beautiful (undeveloped) property in 1989 and built my home and the rental home and, over the years, I've nurtured the 'aina (land).  I enjoy swimming,  boating, and staying active.  Most importantly,  I am happy to share this paradise with you. 

Why this property?  ""Keep the COUNTRY country.""  You will see intermittent signs along the road on your way to the home.  The village of Waikane is in ""the country""  away from the developed and more congested and populated areas of the island, and residents would like to keep it that way!  Here, there are flower farms and  and fruit trees.....a little bit of yesteryear and a country road that hugs the shoreline and takes you along an incredibly scenic drive along the windward coastline and onto the North Shore.  The quiet, windward side of O'ahu, from Kahuku to Kaneohe, is renowned for its lush vegetation, breezy trade winds, spectacular beaches, friendly little towns, and laid-back lifestyle.  With just about everything close at hand and several convenient avenues to Honolulu as well as the North Shore, it is no wonder I fell in love with and chose windward O'ahu, backdropped by the dramatic Ko'olau Mountain range, for my home and business base.  The nearest town is Kane'ohe, only a 15-minute drive, where you will find a variety of restaurants and shopping, a newly-expanded mall, movie theaters, and grocery stores.  

An acre of oceanfront, prettily landscaped with palm trees, flowers, and a lily pond, offers tranquility at the water's edge (the 'ae kai).....Sit and relax:  your view is the Chinaman's Hat sitting in the calm bay and the Ko'olau's rising steeply.

Put on by The Waiʻanae Lions Club and Waikīkī Surf Club, the event was the first international surf contest held in Hawaiʻi and, in 1962, it was the first televised surf contest ever, running on ABC’s “Wide World of Sports.” Nowadays, the break is a proving ground for big wave surfers, and on smaller days, works as a fun surf spot for new and intermediate surfers.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-50832244/original/aead1d0f-5b37-43f4-86ea-617118122142.jpeg,127499739,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/127499739,Jacqui,2017-04-25,,,within a day,100%,100%,t,2.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,$115.00,29,365,29,29,365,365,29.0,365.0,t,3,33,63,306,,15,4,1,2021-12-04,2025-02-13,4.8,5.0,4.73,5.0,4.93,4.53,4.8,f,1,1,0,0

My name is Rustin Smith, and hopefully I’ll be your host during your stay in Honolulu!  

I am married to the the love of my life, a beautiful Japanese national and we have three beautiful daughters.  

I am originally from Alaska.  I am the 3rd child of 3. Older brother and older sister!  I grew up as a small town country boy doing the usual hunting and fishing with my father. He was a bush pilot and so I was able to experience most of the Alaskan Wilderness! 

We raised pigs and chickens, turkeys and ducks, also had a horse and a bunch of dogs and cats!  I played Hockey my entire childhood and loved every minute of it!  I’m kinda a golfer now though!!

After high school, I joined the United States Navy and was stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. After my time in the Navy I stayed in Hawaii and became a self made entrepreneur. I opened my first retail store in Waikiki at the age of 21.  I have opened 2 more locations since then and have been in the customer service industry for 20+years!

I just recently purchased a condo and would like to share my outstanding customer service skills to any and all potential travelers coming to our beautiful state of Hawaii.

Take a couple of our bikes to the village 10-minute cycle or a 3-5 minute drive and there will be all types of restaurants, bars, and local shops.  There are several farmer's markets to check out in town and across the road from us as well as local grocery and take out spots a short walk away.  In 20 minutes you can get to Honolulu where there is more action. The drive feels like you're in Jurrasic Park without the T-Rex.  Honolulu has Waikiki and high-end shopping.

For 16 years I offered horseback rides on Oahu, but moved to the Big Island with my horses when the ranch lease recently expired. 

Originally from the Midwest, I did a stint in the military, which brought me to the islands in 1978.  My education includes an AA in Foreign Languages, a BA in Psychology and completion of a Master's program in Guidance & Counseling. 
 
I'm a Christian, who believes the good Lord brought me to this fantastic place.
I love the serene beauty and quiet of this location, and since the house is much larger than one person needs, wish to share it with traveling guests,  who will also enjoy its comfort and fabulous views.  Besides that, the horses still ""eat like horses"", even though they are no longer earning their keep!

As a pet lover, I would prefer folks who also like animals.  Because I have so many, I don't have a chance to travel much, although in the past I did get the opportunity to visit Spain, France, Switzerland  and England.  I was stationed in Florida & CA as well as Hawaii while in the military.
