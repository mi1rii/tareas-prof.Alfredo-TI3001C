We are a working farm located on the east side of the island of Hawaii, about 30 min south of Hilo on the Puna Coast, close to the quaint village of Pahoa.
We spend our days tending to gardens, the fruit orchards, maybe a day at the local black sand beach called Kehena, playing volleyball or just watching sunsets.
Our guests tend to be outdoor types who love to be in nature.  We invite you up for coffee if you'd like or you can hang by yourself and we'll ignore you if that's what you want.  Then you'll be in your own little paradise and only contacting us when you need info or want to chat.
A couple of mottos to live by include:
'Ua mau ke ea o ka'aina i ka pono o Hawaii'  -- The life of the land in Hawaii is preserved in righteousness.
'Aloha mai no, aloha aku; o ka huhu ka mea e ola ' ole ai' ---When love is given, love should be returned; anger is the thing that gives no life.
