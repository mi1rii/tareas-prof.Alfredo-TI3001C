My name is Patti and I have lived on the Big Island for over 15 years. (And have enjoyed each year more and more). I live with my best friends
Kai (dog) and Sugar (cat) on the property. I am a very  polite and  responsible person with much Aloha, I love meeting new people from all around the world. I am semi retired,  I own a small company and usually work from home. When I first decided to move to Hawaii from California I came to The Big Island to recuperate from a recent back surgery and stayed with a friend who had recently moved here. Got on the plane after about 12 weeks to go back to my old life. Not a bad one mind you, I didn’t need to run away I choose too!  I was hooked! I sold my home put everything in storage and shipped over my 4Runner! And I have enjoyed each and everyday with no regrets. When you stay here We can talk story or if you wish I will be like a ninja and you will only see me when you check in and/out or if anything is needed.
Looking forward to meeting you.
Mahalo,
Patti

A little about myself; 
I moved to the Big Island in 1993 from Guam after serving a short stint in the USCG during the Golf War,  then worked as an acute care nurse at our local Hilo hospital for the last 22 years.  

Ive remained mesmerized by this island’s amazing natural beauty, diverse ecosystems, terrains, and love the laid back lifestyle it provides which easily translated into me transforming my house to one I can happily and proudly share with those seeking to explore and experience this amazing island in a relaxed home setting.  

I'm originally  from the Micronesian Island of Yap,  known for its pristine water, manta ray dives ( check out the world-famous  Yap Divers ) and  its colorful and spirited bamboo war dance performed by bare chested natives in lion clothes and grass skirts, something I grew up doing.   
I embrace  cultural diversity and truly enjoy meeting people from all walks of life and all regions in the world.  I take pride in my house and the service that I provide my guests. I value my precious 'free' time by sneaking in sporadic reading here and there  and enjoying the outdoors; camping, hiking, swimming, kayaking, paddle board, and gardening, but most of all, I love traveling and looking forward to seeing a lot more of this amazing world we live in and experience different cultures along the way.

I’m always striving for a balanced lifestyle; healthy living through heath conscious cooking utilizing locally grown, ( a lot are my own home grown) produce, keeping physically active, and inner peace and serenity.   

I look forward to meeting you and I'm excited to host another amazing adventurous soul seeking to experience the Big Island of Hawaii!

I fell in love with the Big Island for the first time in 97. Since then I've explored homesteading and a closer connection to our land. I have been building and creating. Now I am ready to share the house with travelers who visit this magical place. I am into a peaceful sustainable existence, that gives rest to a fast moving civilization. Sometimes it is enough to just look at the stars, and here you can see them well, or just return to the original TV, a nice relaxing fire. And I love to cook on the flames, so simple, so good. Sharing food is my favorite form of communion. I love slow cooking, whether it be smoking or stew making. Slower and longer is just better if you ask me. 

I am a builder, and as a builder the most gratifying thing is to see people enjoying the manifestations that have been created. Sometimes the focus of what it means to construct something for the utilitarian purpose gets lost in the process. But, the magic is always underlying everything, so many times pure serendipity is right there, reminding us. The intention is everything and construed in all the stones carried, wood carved, land sculpted and much, much else. When the energy is pure, then it is easily conveyed or felt. This land is unfolding as the volcano has taught us. All who become part of this history will see how powerful is the asking. My experience here is that there is an instant reflection in the asking.

A little about myself; 
I moved to the Big Island in 1993 from Guam after serving a short stint in the USCG during the Golf War,  then worked as an acute care nurse at our local Hilo hospital for the last 22 years.  

Ive remained mesmerized by this island’s amazing natural beauty, diverse ecosystems, terrains, and love the laid back lifestyle it provides which easily translated into me transforming my house to one I can happily and proudly share with those seeking to explore and experience this amazing island in a relaxed home setting.  

I'm originally  from the Micronesian Island of Yap,  known for its pristine water, manta ray dives ( check out the world-famous  Yap Divers ) and  its colorful and spirited bamboo war dance performed by bare chested natives in lion clothes and grass skirts, something I grew up doing.   
I embrace  cultural diversity and truly enjoy meeting people from all walks of life and all regions in the world.  I take pride in my house and the service that I provide my guests. I value my precious 'free' time by sneaking in sporadic reading here and there  and enjoying the outdoors; camping, hiking, swimming, kayaking, paddle board, and gardening, but most of all, I love traveling and looking forward to seeing a lot more of this amazing world we live in and experience different cultures along the way.

I’m always striving for a balanced lifestyle; healthy living through heath conscious cooking utilizing locally grown, ( a lot are my own home grown) produce, keeping physically active, and inner peace and serenity.   

I look forward to meeting you and I'm excited to host another amazing adventurous soul seeking to experience the Big Island of Hawaii!

I have been a property manager and owner for 19 years. 30 years ago, I made Lantana my home, and I am proud to say it is still the great coastal town that I grew up loving. Whether you enjoy going to the beach, boating, shopping, or sampling the local fare, Lantana is the place to go - and stay a little while. 

I have also spent a lot of time on the Big Island of Hawaii, and like most, remain fascinated by all that it has to offer.  This was why I took on the adventure of converting shipping containers into off-grid vacation bungalows on the lava fields of Kalapana. It was an adventure I will never forget. These lush interiors are situated directly on the lava field and under a night sky lit by thousands of twinkling stars.  With the ocean as your view and Kilauea volcano in your backyard, it is truly a once in a lifetime experience you won’t soon forget.

I was once a homeless couch surfer and he came from a privileged family, yet humble and kind as can be. We met in the most unlikely place in the middle of Hawaii and have been with each other ever since. We own the real estate, however, I am the management team of the properties. This has become my full-time career along with the crazy restaurant in Hawaii. I put in 120% energy when embarking on a purchase of real property and converting into the ultimate vacation or long term rental experience. Yes, I do both. I grew up in the world of hospitality on the Islands of Maui and Oahu. I have eaten, resided and worked with all demographics. I love to travel and have stayed in my fair share of short term rentals that were never meant to be advertised as such. I used this as education and the inspiration to start one of my most successful ventures in my life. I know what I am truly passionate about. The pandemic was a two fold lesson and I am learning to embrace the change everyday. I hope you enjoy the mountain house or the hale in Hawaii as much as we do. It is the fruit of my hard work to read the honest review of another human who, recognizes how much effort was put forth.
I would love to invite anyone, who reads to the end of this story, a complimentary item or discount to their Experience Activity in Hawaii, a new form of business we decided to partner with Airbnb with.  The Surf and Bento package Experience is live. Please stay tuned on canoe rides, VIP tours and lei creation classes. We are bringing back the vintage world.

A little about myself; 
I moved to the Big Island in 1993 from Guam after serving a short stint in the USCG during the Golf War,  then worked as an acute care nurse at our local Hilo hospital for the last 22 years.  

Ive remained mesmerized by this island’s amazing natural beauty, diverse ecosystems, terrains, and love the laid back lifestyle it provides which easily translated into me transforming my house to one I can happily and proudly share with those seeking to explore and experience this amazing island in a relaxed home setting.  

I'm originally  from the Micronesian Island of Yap,  known for its pristine water, manta ray dives ( check out the world-famous  Yap Divers ) and  its colorful and spirited bamboo war dance performed by bare chested natives in lion clothes and grass skirts, something I grew up doing.   
I embrace  cultural diversity and truly enjoy meeting people from all walks of life and all regions in the world.  I take pride in my house and the service that I provide my guests. I value my precious 'free' time by sneaking in sporadic reading here and there  and enjoying the outdoors; camping, hiking, swimming, kayaking, paddle board, and gardening, but most of all, I love traveling and looking forward to seeing a lot more of this amazing world we live in and experience different cultures along the way.

I’m always striving for a balanced lifestyle; healthy living through heath conscious cooking utilizing locally grown, ( a lot are my own home grown) produce, keeping physically active, and inner peace and serenity.   

I look forward to meeting you and I'm excited to host another amazing adventurous soul seeking to experience the Big Island of Hawaii!  

Welcome & E Komo Mai!

In his downtime, you’ll find him enjoying the perks of island living; hiking, kayaking, stand up paddle boarding, golfing, quality time with friends and family.

You won't find any buildings taller than a palm tree here, and ALOHA is not just a word, it's a way of life.<br /><br />One of the longest white sand beaches in Hawaii can be found here, and you might just have it all to yourself. There's so little automobile traffic that there's not a single traffic light. No malls, no elevators, and no neon. Burger wars? Not here.<br /><br />Shop in small, friendly businesses in Kaunakakai, the largest town, and in the villages of Kualapuu and Kumu, where local markets offer fresh produce and homemade goods. Life here is slow and relaxed, rural and peaceful. It's like stepping back in time 50 years. Come experience the magic of Molokai, a place like no other.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-52678074/original/6e40c8cb-a0e2-4c39-ab3b-99aa8af127e4.jpeg,75915740,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/75915740,Dana,2016-06-05,"Hawaii, United States",Aloha and welcome to the paradise!,within an hour,100%,100%,f,9.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,99.0,3,365,3,3,365,365,3.0,365.0,t,27,57,87,267,,22,14,2,2023-12-17,2025-02-25,4.82,4.86,4.77,4.91,4.82,4.86,4.86,t,7,7,0,0

In his downtime, you’ll find him enjoying the perks of island living; hiking, kayaking, stand up paddle boarding, golfing, quality time with friends and family.

Matthew has built a solid foundation of successfully guiding local, national and multi-national clients with their real estate acquisitions on Maui. He specializes in applying his expertise and market knowledge to each transaction. Matthew’s portfolio of high-end residential sales include over $24 million dollars in career sales.

Some of our favorite places to travel:  Greece, London, the Big Island of Hawaii, and the Cinque Terre (Italy).  But any place that opens our eyes to new things is great.  

We share our time between San Francisco and the Big Island. Jon works in solar energy and Fahmida in neuropsychology. 

We are both from the Midwest, primarily reside in San Francisco and were married on the Big Island. We purchased our first home on the Big Island because it is a special place for us. 

As hosts we want share the aloha spirit and the sanctuary of our peaceful retreat with you. 

Hope to be traveling in your neck of the woods soon or sharing our part of the woods with you.
