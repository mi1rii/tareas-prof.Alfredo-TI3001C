In fact there is a network of fantastic walking and running trails all over Princeville, making it likely the safest and easiest of locations of the island to walk or take a run. Another bonus is that many of the nearby golf courses are open for pedestrian exploration after 5pm, which is beyond excellent for sunset strolls.<br /><br />The coastline below Princeville provides some of the most pristine, clear water on the North Shore due to the lack of rivers and fresh water runoff.

I am Lani and I am passionate about sharing and passing on the love I have for my island Home of Kauai to those who visit this special place.

I’ve lived on Kauai for much of my life. I was born near Tunnels Beach and have always considered the North Shore of Kauai “home”. However, adventures beyond the islands, eventually brought me to the mainland and abroad.  I went to school in Santa Cruz California and even got interested in colder climates for a while. Between travels abroad, I worked as an entrepreneur and in various outdoor industries for the better part of a decade, living in amazingly scenic, rural towns. One of my favorite of those towns was Jackson Hole Wyoming, where I lived for several years before moving back to Kauai. It took searching the world to ultimately realize, there’s no place like home.  

I truly enjoy passing on the love and reverence I have of my island home to my guests. I offer my local knowledge and recommendations in addition to providing exceptional quality accommodation and service. I want to ensure that my guests have as much fun and as little worries as possible on their visits to Kauai!

I love offering conscientious  travelers an amazing home while they explore the Garden Island, and both my condos are thoughtfully equipped, well located and always kept clean and attended to with lots of love.

I am are honored to have received such great reviews, and maintained a consistent Airbnb SuperHost rating that I have held strong for several years.

I am grateful for my guests, as they give to me just as much as I give them.

Happiest of travels and lots of Aloha to you!
