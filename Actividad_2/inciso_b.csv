Hilo could become known as 'the town that time forgot' because it has the flavor of an older, slower Hawaii. In that way we are pretty easy going and relaxed ourselves. We have two guest cottages and a romantic 1 bedroom apartment here at The Lotus Garden. This is a property that features two garden courtyards, stone Buddha statues, a fish pond and an abundance of tropical plants and trees. . The Lotus Garden is reminiscent of the former 'sugar cane plantation days' when houses were clustered together so that there was a sense of community in the way people lived. Here Travelers meet other travelers in passing. Another wonderful feature of The Lotus Garden is that we are right in the center of town.

The 10-acre ocean-view property is blessed with average daytime temperatures of 85° F year-round, and 65° F at night, with cool, fragrant trade winds, surrounding tropical flora, including old growth mangoes, nearby swimming, surfing and snorkeling.

This property was once a papaya farm and is now newly planted with bamboo, papaya, palms, banana and many other fruit trees. The octagonal Balinese meditation pavilion is set among shade-trees with an expansive view of the ocean. The island wildlife is all around us – a variety of birds by day and at night there's the pleasant chirping of Coqui frogs – and there are no snakes. Natural wonders include Volcanoes National Park, for lava and crater viewing, volcanically heated warm ponds and steam vents (as outdoor saunas) and other wonders of the lush tropics.

Kmec opened in the summer of 2008 for pre-arranged seasonal meditation retreats and private meditation-vacations on request. Additionally, we would like to extend our welcome to Big Island travelers offering cozy cottages and open air kitchen and bath. We offer daily free meditation instructions and practices at our beautiful Balinese meditation pavillion. Additionally, we offer Yoga and nature tours upon guest's request (donations accepted).

I've traveled extensively to England, Germany, France, Italy, India, Thailand, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico, Hawaii, Ukraine, and Israel.

Merlock L.L.C. is a web hosting and I.T. consulting business that builds customized software for businesses to enhance productivity. We are also innovators of green energy equipment such as devices that recycle used cooking oil into cost effective vehicle fuel.

My dream is to use the profits of our labor to start a non-profit company that will help disadvantaged people around the world, afford medical care. Specifically a program that will send doctors from the US to the third world, to train mid-level healthcare workers to effectively treat the sick. I believe that everyone should have equal access to healthcare, regardless of socioeconomic status. 

While in college I owned a company that produced raves and concerts near San Francisco. While I don't produce raves anymore, I still run f8gear.com on the side, which sells music. 

I joke around a lot and act like a kid when I'm around cute little pets. I love plants and growing plants. If I get an avocado (yum!) I plant the seed. 

One indicator of successful people is their ability to choose a greater reward that takes longer to achieve, versus an inferior reward that takes less time. I typically wait the longer period for the greater reward.

Congratulations on your decision to book a vacation in sunny Maui, Hawaii; the #1 island in the world for over 25 years.  :)

I would be honored to help you choose accommodations in Maui that fit your needs, desires, and budget. 

As a full-time resident on Maui for over 15 years, I am very familiar with all that this wonderful Island has to offer.  I absolutely love my job as both an owner and property manager of vacation rentals on Maui.  The fact that I get to help others plan their Hawaiian vacation and/or relocation to the magical island of Maui is literally the icing on top of the cupcake!

If you are wanting to purchase property on Maui, I am a licensed realtor in the State of Hawai'i, own a property management company in Maui, and am also a certified Home Staging Expert.  I would love to speak with you and answer any questions you might have about vacation rentals on Maui.

In addition to managing lots of amazing properties directly across the street from the awesome, sun kissed beaches of south Maui, I am also the proud owner of my own vacation rentals.   The condos I own are called Tracy’s Tropical Treasures.  They are listed on Airbnb as Tracy's Tropical Treasure #1 (Ocean View), Tracy's Tropical Treasure #2 (Corner Penthouse), Tracy's Tropical Treasure #3 (Ocean View), and my newest addition, Paradise Awaits You! Tracy's Tropical Treasure #4 (Ocean View, Central A.C., and double pane windows, so no road noise inside the condo).  *Tracy’s Tropical Treasure #3 and Paradise Awaits You! Tracy's Tropical Treasure #4 both house up to 4 guests.  :)

Tracy’s Tropical Treasures were Named the #1 Vacation Rentals in all of Maui in 2016.

In November, 2019, I was RANKED #1 again.  ;)

In July of 2022, I was ranked #1 in Kihei for the fourth time.

I have worked very hard for these achievements and on every single occasion, it was one of the best days of my life when I received confirmation that I had won the award.  

I look forward to speaking with you, helping you with your Maui vacation/relocation, and sharing my ALOHA spirit.  I have been in the hospitality industry for over 25 years, and it's really how I choose to live my life.  Pampering guests is my #1 priority!  

* With well over 1000 bookings on the 4 rentals I personally own, I am extremely proud and take great pride in the fact that I have so many wonderful reviews.  Please feel free to check out all the reviews on Airbnb for the proof.   Customer Service is very important to me!

I am also very proud that I have been with Airbnb since 2009 and have also been a ""SUPERHOST” since the program was created.  In July of 2022, I earned Superhost status for the 33rd consecutive time.  

Airbnb is, without a doubt, the BEST vacation rental platform of all!  

When Airbnb was first created, I was one of only eight listings in all of Maui.  My claim to fame is that Brian Chesky, himself, actually called me.  Brian is one of the three Airbnb founders.  Back then, I had also listed my car on Airbnb, and Brian said I was the first person to ever list a car on his platform.  He thought it was interesting, and we had a very nice telephone conversation.

By the end of 2020, Maui had over 18,000 vacation rental listings.  The Airbnb platform has grown exponentially.  I am truly honored to be a part of it all; both as an owner and as a property manager and will continue to tell everyone how wonderful Airbnb is for hosts and travelers alike.

Everybody, no matter where they are, can live ALOHA.  Maui is a great way to unlock the positive spirit within all of us.....

Make it a great day!

I live most of the year in San Francisco and escape to Maui whenever I get tired of the foggy weather. I run a small software company and have the good fortune of being able to work anywhere there's an internet connection. Luckily that's the case with Maui, so whenever I get an urge for whale watching, diving, or laying in the sun it's no problem coming over. I love diving and the diving in Maui is spectacular, there are some really beautiful spots. I also have a passion for photography, particularly whales and outdoor scenes, so you'll see some of my work on the walls of the unit.

I hope you'll check out my place. I put a lot of work into it making sure it was a livable space for when I'm there. So I think the standards I have for the condo is much higher than most rental units.

I bought this because I'll be there about two months of the year and I wanted something on the ocean. A friend of mine lives in the same building so I was very familiar with the property and all it offered (ok, so mostly it offered the ocean about 20 feet way :-).

I've been very blessed to enjoy traveling as a child while my dad was in the military and then as an adult for my job and with my husband.  We began visiting Hawaii in 1999 and our annual visits turned into our first purchase of a vacation home in 2006.  It was on our 4th trip to the Big Island of Hawaii and during our 2nd stay at the Keauhou Kona Surf and Racquet Club that we began looking for our own place.  The diversity of this island paradise and the wonderful snorkeling and the lovely townhouse settings made all the other complexes pale in comparison on our searches - we purchased townhouse #59 and returned for our fifth trip to completely redo the unit (tile to ceiling) in preparation for personal and guest visits.  We still feel the same way about this wonderful place and now own a second, completely oceanfront unit (#196) in this same lovely complex.  And, it's only gotten better.  Our goal in rentals is to offer what we'd want and expect in a unit if we were traveling.  Super clean, well maintained, simple and beautful decor, plenty of space to pack away our suitcases and settle in comfortably, good beds & linens, and complete kitchens for at home meals whenever we like.  Fortunately for us, many of our guests appreciate and expect the same type of accomodation and we have several guests or groups of guests that have become repeat visitors to our lovely place/s.  All have said this is the best place they've found and the first place they check for return visits.  We love and appreciate all of our guests but even more so our repeat or referred guests.  We'd be delighted to welcome you and your friends to a stay in paradise. Our motto in life - pay it forward; be the first to do the right thing; set the right example; good karma will follow you.  Our guests should know that we will do everything to help them enjoy their stay with us.
